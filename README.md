# Waste-Water-Management-Analysis
Waste Water Management Analysis Using Python

# Background
The waste water management project aims to monitor and optimize the treatment and 
disposal of wastewater in USA. The project involves multiple wastewater treatment 
plants, sources of waste water across various locations. The main objective is to ensure 
efficient treatment of wastewater.

# Goals
• Ensure efficient and responsible treatment of wastewater to improve 
  effectiveness and efficiency.
• Integrate data from different sources and performing analysis.
• Design Analytical Report.
• Provide Recommendations based on analytical report.

# Objective and Scope
1.Data Collection and observation: The project emphasis lies on collecting data 
related to treatment Plants, sources of waste water, and treatment results. These metrics
are used for analyzing the overall performance of treatment facilities.
2.Performance Analysis: The project aims to evaluate the performance of different 
treatment facilities. It seeks to identify areas of improvement, optimize treatment 
efficiency, and enhance the overall effectiveness of wastewater management systems.
3.Analysis of Waste Water Sources: The project recognizes the importance of 
understanding the sources of wastewater and their specific characteristics. It aims to 
analyze wastewater based on different sources such as residential, healthcare, or 
industrial to identify any specific treatment requirements.

# Deliverable

1. Data Consolidation and Transformation: Consolidation of relevant data sources, 
such as wastewater treatment plant data, sources of waste water data into a structured 
format suitable for analysis.
2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Identify key performance indicators related to 
wastewater management.

3. Analytical Report: Creation analytical reports that provide insights into wastewater 
treatment performance. These visualizations are helpful in monitoring KPIs, identify 
trends, and to make data-driven decisions for process optimization.

4. Recommendations: Recommendations based on data analysis to optimize 
wastewater treatment processes, minimize resource consumption, and enhance overall 
efficiency.
